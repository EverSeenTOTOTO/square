# square

A toy Lisp-like language written in Rust, supports first-class function and continuation, aims to be both fun and expressive.

## Q & A

1.  What's this?

    **Square** is a neat Lisp-inspired language, crafted with Rust. It's all about simplicity and cleanliness, aiming to reduce the reliance on control keys like `<Ctrl>` and `<Shift>`. That's why it uses symbols like `.`, `[]`, `;`, and `/` to structure the code.

    **Square** is parsed by a recursive descent algorithm, compiled to a custom instruction set, and operates on a stack-based virtual machine. The source code, written with a Rust `no_std` environment and can be compiled to a incredibly lightweight wasm file.

2.  Why called **square**?

    **Square** use `[]` rather than `()` which is adopted in most lisp languages, giving it a truly "square" shape that matches its name.

## Variable

```lisp
; basic
[let x 2] ; x = 2

[let x [.. 1 4]] ; x = [1 2 3 4], `..` can concat strings, ranges and vectors

; expansion
[let [x y] [vec 1 2]] ; x = 1, y = 2

; convenient placehoders in expansion
[let [. x] [vec 1 2 3]] ; x = 2, `.` is a placehoder that MUST occupy one position
[let [... x] [.. 1 10]] ; x = 10, `...` is a placehoder that can occupy zero or as many positions as possible
[let [. [x] ... y] [vec 1 [vec 2] 3 4 5]] ; x = 2, y  5
```

## Control flow

```lisp
; match
[cond
  [[> -2.3e-2 x] foo]
  [[[regex '[a-z]+' 'gi'].test x] bar]]

; branch
[if true true]
[if true true false]

; block
[begin 
  [let i 0]
  [while [< i 10]
    [print i]
    [+= i 1]]]
```

## Function(first class)

```lisp
; function starts with /[ as it looks like Î»
[let foo /[] 2]

[foo]

; expansion in parameter
[let foo /[. z] [print [.. z 4]]]

[foo 'ignored' 0]

[let fib /[n] 
  [if [<= n 2] 
    1
    [+ [fib [- n 1]] [fib [- n 2]]]]]

[println [fib 30]]

[print [[.. 1 10].map /[x] [fib x]]]
```

## Continuation(first class)

```lisp
[let gen /[yield]
    [begin
        [let i 0]
        [while [< i 10]
            [callcc /[cc]
                [yield [vec i cc]]]]]]

[let innerCc nil]

[let next /[g]
    [if [== [typeof innerCc] 'fn']
        [innerCc]
        [begin
            [let p [callcc /[cc] [g cc]]]
            [if [== [typeof p] 'vec']
                [begin
                    [let i nil]
                    [= [i innerCc] p]
                    [print i]]]]]]
                    
[next gen]
[next gen]
[next gen]
[next gen]
[next gen]

```

## Structure(WIP)

```lisp
[let o [obj 
        ['x' 42]
        ['inc' /[this] [+= this.x 1]]]]

[println o]
[o.inc]
[println o]
```

## Comment

```lisp
; comment
; inline ;
```

## BNF

    hex -> [0-9a-fA-F]
    ascii_escape -> x hex hex
    unicode_escape -> u hex{4}
    single_escape -> ['\\bfnrtv]

    escape -> \\ ascii_escape | unicode_escape | single_escape

    str -> ' ([^'\\\r\n] | escape )* '
    num -> -?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(e|E-?[0-9]+)?

    expand -> [ (. | ... | id | expand)+ ]
    fn -> / expand expr

    prop ->  . id
    assign -> let (expand | id) expr | = (expand | id prop*) expr

    op -> (operator expr expr*) | (assign_operator id prop* expr*)

    call -> [ assign | op | expr* ]

    dot -> (id | call) prop*

    expr -> fn | str | -?(num | dot)
